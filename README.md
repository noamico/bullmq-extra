# BullMQ Extra

BullMQ Extra is a set of additional features and extensions for the much
beloved [BullMQ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bullmq).
The library currently provides specialized patterns like Routing and Joining, with more useful features to come which
are currently not available in the core BullMQ library.

## Installation:

```bash
npm install bullmq-extra
```

# Features

- [Router](#router)
- [Join](#join)
- [Accumulation](#accumulation)
- [Request-Response](#request-response)
- [Broker](#broker)

## Router:

`Routers` allow you to distribute jobs from one or more source queues to one or more target queues. This is useful for
implementing:

- fan-out (1->N) patterns, where a single job is processed by multiple workers in parallel.
- fan-in (N->1) patterns, where multiple job queues are combined and processed by a single worker.
- fan-in to fan-out (N->N) patterns, where multiple job queues are combined and processed by multiple workers.

Under the hood the `Router` component leverages `Redis Streams` so you basically get the same publish-subscribe
capability as in Kafka,
including retention, consumer groups and message replay,
but at a fraction of the complexity. And the additional useful patterns mentioned above.
Also, as everything ends up in a BullMQ queue, you can use all the features of BullMQ like retries, priorities, etc.
The cost/performance ratio is yet to be benchmarked.

### Basic Usage:

```typescript
import { Queue, Worker } from 'bullmq';
import { Router } from 'bullmq-extra';

// Create source queues somewhere in your application
const sourceQueue1 = new Queue('source1');
const sourceQueue2 = new Queue('source2');

// Create a router to process jobs from the source queue and distribute them to target queues
const targetQueue1 = new Queue('target1');
const targetQueue2 = new Queue('target2');
const router1 = new Router()
  .addSources('source1', 'source2')
  .addTargets(targetQueue1, targetQueue2);

router1.run().then().catch();

// Create multiple routers on the same source queues to different targets
const targetQueue3 = new Queue('target3');
const targetQueue4 = new Queue('target4');
const router2 = new Router()
  .addSources('source1')
  .addTargets(targetQueue3, targetQueue4);
router2.run().then().catch();

// Add jobs to the source queues
sourceQueue1.add('job', { data: 'data1' });
sourceQueue2.add('job', { data: 'data2' });

// The jobs will be delivered to all the target queues
```

### Advanced Options (`RouterOptions`):

- **batchSize:** The number of jobs to process in a single batch. Default is 1.

- **blockTimeMs:** The time to wait before polling after an empty batch. Default is 1 second.

- **maxRetentionMs:** The maximum time to retain a job in the router stream. Default is 24 hours.

- **trimIntervalMs:** The interval in which to trim the router stream. Default is 1 minute.

- **optsOverride:** A function that takes the job data and returns an object with options to override the default
  options for the job.

### Caution:

- Beware of circular dependencies when using routers. This can lead to infinite loops which will overload your Redis.

## Join:

`Joins` allows you to combine jobs from multiple queues into a single queue while joining them on a common key.
This is a common pattern in ETL and data processing pipelines and is now available for BullMQ users as well.

### Basic Usage:

```typescript
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';
import { Join } from 'bullmq-extra';

const join = new Join({
  joinName: 'join1',
  onComplete: (data) => {
    const sum = data.reduce((acc, val) => {
      return acc + val.value;
    }, 0);
    return { sum };
  },
  redis: new IORedis(),
  sources: [
    {
      queue: 'source1',
      getJoinKey: (data) => data.joinKey,
    },
    {
      queue: 'source2',
      getJoinKey: (data) => data.joinKey,
    },
  ],
  target: new Queue('target1'),
  timeout: 1000,
});
join.run();

// Add jobs to the source queues
sourceQueue1.add('job', { joinKey: 'key1', value: 1 });
sourceQueue2.add('job', { joinKey: 'key1', value: 2 });

// The result of the onComplete function will be added to the target queue

```

## Accumulation:

`Accumulations` allow you to accumulate messages from a queue and output aggregations to a new queue.

### Basic Usage:

```typescript
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';
import { Accumulation } from 'bullmq-extra';

const accumulation = new Accumulation({
  accumulationName: 'accumulation1',
  onComplete: (data) => {
    const sum = data.reduce((acc, val) => {
      return acc + val.value;
    }, 0);
    return { sum };
  },
  opts: { connection },
  source: {
    queue: 'source1',
    getGroupKey: (data) => data.groupKey,
  },
  target: new Queue('target1'),
  timeout: 1000,
  expectedItems: 2,
});
accumulation.run();

// Add jobs to the source queue
sourceQueue1.add('job', { groupKey: 'key1', value: 1 });
sourceQueue1.add('job', { groupKey: 'key1', value: 2 });

// The result of the onComplete function will be added to the target queue
```

*IMPORTANT NOTE: make sure not to re-use keys among different runs, even on the same data!

## Request-Response:

`Requesters` and `Responders` allow you to create a request-response pattern with BullMQ.
The `Requester` sends a job to a queue and waits for a response on a dedicated response queue.
The `Responder` listens for requests on its own queue and sends each response to the appropriate response queue.

### Basic Usage:

```typescript
import { Requester, Responder } from 'bullmq-extra';

// Somewhere in your application create a responder
const responder = new Responder({
  responderName: 'additionJob',
  opts: { connection },
});
responder.processRequests((data: { a: number, b: number }) => {
  return { result: data.a + data.b };
});

// Create a requester or several in other places in your application
const requester1 = new Requester({
  requesterName: 'additionJob1',
  responderName: 'additionJob',
  opts: { connection },
});
requester1.request({ a: 1, b: 2 });
requester1.processResponses((data) => {
  console.log(data); // {result: 3}
});

const requester2 = new Requester({
  requesterName: 'additionJob2',
  responderName: 'additionJob',
  opts: { connection },
});
requester2.request({ a: 1, b: 5 });
requester2.processResponses((data) => {
  console.log(data); // {result: 6}
});
```

## Broker:

`Brokers` are designed to run as sidecars to processes in non-nodejs languages and provide a thin API for producing and
consuming messages from BullMQ.
The broker will expose a REST API for producing and consuming messages and will handle all the BullMQ specifics like
retries, priorities, etc.

### Basic Usage:
The broker is packaged into a docker container and should be run as a sidecar to your service.
```
docker pull ghcr.io/orrgal1/bullmq-broker:latest
```

It accepts the following environment variables:
- `REDIS_HOST`: The host of the Redis server.
- `REDIS_PORT`: The port of the Redis server.
- `BROKER_PORT`: The port on which the broker will listen for requests.

```typescript
// When the broker processes messages it will send the data to a POST callback endpoint which your service must provide
// The following example is in node but the idea is to have this in another language

// Create a Queue called test
await axios.post('http://localhost:3003/queue', {
  name: 'test',
  opts: {},
});

// Create a Worker for the queue
await axios.post('http://localhost:3003/worker', {
  name: 'test',
  callback: 'http://localhost:3002/job', // The callback endpoint in your own service
  opts: {},
});

// Add a job to the queue. The worker will pick up this job and send the data to the callback endpoint.
// The callback endpoint must return a success status code for the job to be marked as completed.
// If the callback endpoint returns an error status code the job will be retried or discarded as per the Queue options.
await axios.post('http://localhost:3003/job', {
  name: 'test',
  data: { a: 3, b: 4 },
  opts: {},
});
```

### Thin Clients:
Thin clients are built to interact with the broker and provide a thin convenient API for utilizing the full power of BullMQ + BullMQ Extra in languages other than NodeJS.

Currently, the following thin clients are available:

### [Java](https://github.com/orrgal1/bullmq-thin-java/packages/2315290)

### Roadmap:

- Add more thin clients for various languages like Python and Go to bring the power of BullMQ to those languages
  and allow integrating BullMQ into legacy codebases.
- Support for all `bullmq-extra` patterns like `Router`, `Join`, `Accumulation`, `Request-Response` will be added.
- Support the Kafka protocol for compatibility with existing Kafka clients.

## Caution:

- The package is new so breaking changes are to be expected until version 1.0.0.

## Roadmap:

- **BullMQ Connect:** Similiar to Kafka Connect, a way to connect BullMQ to other systems. Will probably be a separate
  package or several.
